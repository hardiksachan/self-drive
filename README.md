Autonomous driving using Carla.

## Sensors Used

### For prod

- Front facing rgb camera.

### For data collection

- Front facing camera with semantic segmentation.

## Project checklist

Currently we have two major goals/pipeline:

- [ ] Semantic Segmentation from dashcam stream.

- [ ] RL model to control race and steering based on traffic and GPS.
  - [ ] Control steering based on GPS (Carla waypoints) at constant race and no traffic.
